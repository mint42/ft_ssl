# FT_SSL

ft_ssl is a simple openssl recreation, including the md5, sha256, and sha224 algorithms. This is a security project in the 42 curriculum. It introduces the concepts of hashing and message digest, and also the _basics_ of encryption.

## Getting Started

ft_ssl uses [my 42 library](https://github.com/mint42/libft) which has been included as a git submodule. To set up this project, run `git clone https://github.com/mint42/ft_select` in the folder of your choice. Next, from the root of the ft_ssl repository run `git submodule update --init libft` to import the contents of the libft repository. Finally you can run `make` which will use the Makefile to build the library, and then the executable file `ft_ssl`.

```
usage: ft_ssl command [command opts] [command args]
```
